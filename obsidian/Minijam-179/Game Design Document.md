## Introduction
### Game Summary
Synthesis is a puzzle game about piecing together the harmonics of a target sound.
### Inspiration
[I Love Hue](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.zutgames.ilovehue&hl=en-US) is a similarly themed puzzle game. It is similar to Synthesis in that the goal is to recreate a target using your senses, in this case sight vs sound. It has the same peaceful, comfortable vibes that I'm aiming for, with pretty visuals and audio.
### Player Experience
Players will proceed through randomly generated levels. Each level, the player will be presented with a target sound and a visual display of the frequencies that make it up. Players will have a number of harmonic sliders that they can drag around to try and match the harmonic. Once the target sound has been approximated closely enough, the player wins and moves onto the next level.
### Platform

## Concept
### Gameplay Overview
Synthesis is a UI heavy game. Gameplay consists of dragging a number of sliders to try and approximate a target sound which can be started and stopped at will. They may also use the visual information provided by the spectrum analysis graph to assist them.

### Limitation Interpretation (Creation through Destruction)
[Subtractive synthesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subtractive_synthesis) is a common method of generating sounds for synthesizers, involving subtracting, filtering, or *destroying* overtones of a signal in order to *create* a new signal.

### Design
### Software
## Audio
Heavy use of reverb and other filters to improve the sound of the raw audio signals and stuff.
### Music
There will be little to no supplemental music, since the focus is on the audio signal you are generating. There might be a bit of background randomly generated noise to punctuate the background, and maybe the audio you generate will play a ditty at the end!
### Sound Effects
Soft computerized clicks used for pressing sliders and stuff probably
